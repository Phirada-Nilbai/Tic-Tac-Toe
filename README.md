# Flutter Tic Tac Toe Game
#### This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game built with Flutter and Dart. The game is played between two players on a 4x4 grid and 5x5 grid. The first player uses "X" while the second player uses "O". The winner is the first player to get four or five of their symbols in a row, either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.

## How to Play
1. Start the application on your emulator or device.
2. Tap on any cell on the grid to make your move.
3. Alternate turns with the other player until one of you gets four or five symbols in a row.
